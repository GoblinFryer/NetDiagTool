## **3. What/How To Edit**

For the script to run properly you have some modifications to do. Open the .ps1 file and search the following words : **"YouOwnInternalServerToTest"** and **"YourDomain"** and replace them by your needed equivalent - the executable is not formated wich will make some informations not to be displayed.
